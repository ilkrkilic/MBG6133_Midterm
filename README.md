*In this section, I'll try to create an imaginary tool which can show the docking process of the proteins*

**2. Usage of the Tool**

### Explanation of the Tool ###
 This tool can be used to simulate the docking process of the proteins to their ligands. As you may know the protein docking process is actually hard to visualize as we don't have most of the tools that can show the interaction of a protein with its ligand.<br />
 So how do we get around this problem? Well with this tool you can find the docking process of the proteins to their ligands easily
 ### Usage of the Tool ###
 This tool uses the data that you collected from different docking programs and papers that has been published about the spesific docking process that you are looking for.<br />
 Then it can calculate the approximate docking process with <br />
 1.Looking at the docking sites of both the protein and ligand<br />
 2.Calculating the approximate binding of the protein-ligand formation<br />
 3.Giving you the expected results of both the dock sites and the 3D structure of the newly formed Protein-Ligand formation

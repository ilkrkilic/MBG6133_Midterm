*In this section, I'll try to create an imaginary tool which can show the docking process of the proteins*

**1. Explanation of the Tool**\
**2. Usage of the Tool**

### Explanation of the Tool ###
 This tool can be used to simulate the docking process of the proteins to their ligands. As you may know the protein docking process is actually hard to visualize as we don't have most of the tools that can show the interaction of a protein with its ligand.<br />
 So how do we get around this problem? Well with this tool you can find the docking process of the proteins to their ligands easily
 ### Usage of the Tool ###
 This tool uses the data that you collected from different docking programs
